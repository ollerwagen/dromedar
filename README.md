# Dromedar Programming Language

Dromedar is a statically and strongly typed _safe_ programming language.

I plan on including strings, arrays, as well as first-class function objects in this language, supported by a garbage collector mixing the mark/sweep and reference counting approaches.

So far, it can only emulate a stack machine as it only supports primitive types as of now.

See the Doc folder for the extensive documentation file.
